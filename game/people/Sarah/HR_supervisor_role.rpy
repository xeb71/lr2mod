# ****HR Director role****
# Early game: She adds her charisma and HR skill to max efficiency. Lets events scale this factor up
# Mid game: She can help shape employee work interests. She will automatically work with employees in different departments increasing their relevant likes and dislikes.
#   Once per week, you can target an individual girl and a specific work interest.
# As she gets corrupted, the opinions she can train evolve. EG: showing tits, skimpy uniforms
# Late game: Unlocks threesome scenes with employees.
#
# Required Labels
# Initial Hiring
# First Monday review
# Subsequent Monday meetings
# HR Stage One event: Beginning once a week, can have personal interview with one employee.
# HR stage two event: Can create new training videos to be looped in break rooms, emphasizing "company values"
# HR stage three event: Company sponsored sexual training.
