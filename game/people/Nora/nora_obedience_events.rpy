# Nora's obedience events involve meeting with, and eventually controlling the University Dean
# Early on, you push Nora to contracting the company for producing serums
# Next, we push Nora to get the University to contract out some serum testing with MC's company
# Next, we push Nora to begin dosing the University Dean with the serums we are contracted to make for them
# Finally, MC and Nora bring the Dean under their control. Ends with MC controlling Nora, who controls the Dean.
