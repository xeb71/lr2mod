# All of the role specific actions for Nora
# Nora acts as an alternate way of unlocking serum research progress and allows the player to unlock special serum traits.

# Nora needs the player to help her cut through bureaucratic red tape and test serum traits that she can't.
# She gives the player (temporary) access to a serum trait with a very high side effect chance, strange/extreme effects, and minimal sale value.
# The player needs to raise the mastery value of the trait to a certain level, after which they can "turn in" the request for a reward.
# Initially this reward will be access to higher serum tech tiers or unlocks of other serum traits without having to research them.
# Later it may let you unlock unique serum traits.
