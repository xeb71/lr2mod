    mc.name "So, I've heard hints that it was a bit rough but, how was it at the lab after I left?"
    the_person "Ah geeze. Yeah things got tough."
    the_person "After you left, there was some drama because of some chemical inventory issues... which... really were your fault to begin with."
    the_person "We obviously didn't know that then, and [nora.fname] took the brunt of the investigation."
    mc.name "I'm sorry, I never meant for that to happen."
    the_person "I know. Anyway, after that, the Dean started breathing down our necks 24/7."
    the_person "He started having me and [nora.fname] work a bunch extra, but used some public university labor loophole to get out of paying overtime."
    the_person "The last few months especially, she was starting to act kind of weird..."
    mc.name "Weird how?"
    the_person "I don't know... I can't really describe it, but I got the feeling there was more going on between [nora.fname] and the Dean."
    the_person "I tried asking her a couple times, but was never able to find out."
    mc.name "Interesting."
    the_person "Anyway, I'm thankful that stage of my career is over. I miss working with her, but is kind of nice to be out of that lab."
