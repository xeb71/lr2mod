# Python file for Story_Path and Story_Step class
# Implementation of Path and Step allows us to define entire storylines in python only, allowing them to be loaded at runtime instead of saved to characters.
# Story_Step and Story_Path should only be modified by code, never in game via labels so that they can be modified and expanded easily.
# Characters keep track of what Story_Paths are available and applicable to them, and what step they are on.
