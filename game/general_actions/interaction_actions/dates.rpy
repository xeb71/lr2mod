# C) Go underwear shopping. (Suggest some underwear sets to her. At moderate slut you can sneak in and view it on her.)
# |-> Both of these should include options to peek in on her as she changes (and maybe get caught), or have her invite you in.
# |-> At high Sluttiness you can try and fuck her in the changing booth.
# E) Go electronics shopping. (Chance to spend major cash for Love boost)
# F) Go sex toy shopping. (Chance to increase Sluttiness, but needs high Sluttiness to begin with).
# Z) Go home/Go home early.
